#### Briefly About Myself:
Received the profession of an energy engineer. But today I understand that this is what I would like to do all my life.
He left to work in the technical support of computers, hoping to master the development. Today we are working and creating a new product to automate the work of other support engineers.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
